# The Hook Programming Language

Hook is a simple, small, cross-plataform scripting language with an easy-to-understand implementation. It has been written entirely by hand in C99 using simple techniques like recursive descending parsing, syntax-oriented translation, and stack-based machine.

## Features

The main features are:

* Imperative programming
* C-style
* Dynamic-type
* Immutability by default
* No accidental side effects
* Automatic memory management

Warning: Hook is still in its early stages of development and is obviously not production ready. 

## What does it look like 

```rust
fn factorial(n) {
  if (n == 0)
    return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

## Building and installing

This project uses the CMake build tool. Use the following commands to build the interpreter.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/fabiosvm/hook-lang.git
cd hook-lang
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

The interpreter needs the environment variable `HOOK_HOME` in order to import libraries. Furthermore,
you might want to run scripts from anywhere in the terminal.  

```
echo "export HOOK_HOME=$HOME/hook-lang" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=\$HOOK_HOME/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Running an example

In the `example` folder you will find some code samples.

```
hook example/hello.hook
```

## Displaying the bytecode

The `--dump` option can be used to print the generated bytecode instead of interpreting the code.

```
hook --dump example/factorial.hook
```

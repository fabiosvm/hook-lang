# The Hook Programming Language

Hook is a simple, small, dynamic-typed, imperative, C-style scripting language with an easy-to-understand implementation. It has been written entirely by hand in C99 using simple techniques like recursive descending parsing, syntax-oriented translation, and stack-based machine.

The feature that makes Hook's interpreter different from the rest is the efficient memory management (no memory leakage) through automatic reference counting only, without any other garbage collection mechanism. This is possible because the language has restrictions that prevent the appearance of cyclic references.

Warning: Hook is still in its early stages of development and is obviously not production ready. 

## What does it look like 

```rust
fn factorial(n) {
  if (n == 0)
    return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

## Building

This project uses the CMake build tool. Use the following commands to build the interpreter.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabiosvm/hook-lang.git
cd hook-lang
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Running an example

In the `example` folder you will find some code samples.

```bash
bin/hook example/hello.hook
```

### Displaying the bytecode

The `--disasm` option can be used to print the generated bytecode instead of interpreting the code.

```bash
bin/hook --disasm example/mandelbrot.hook
```
